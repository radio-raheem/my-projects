# Apartment sales ads research

Can we determine the market value of objects, having real estate ads for several previous years?  
Great news: yes we can!  
  
We have the data of the service for placing real estate ads â€” an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in a large Russian city and its suburbs for several years.  
We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate and set key parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.  

Two types of data are available for each apartment. The first one is entered by the user, the second one is obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, the airport, the nearest park and reservoir.

The main steps of our project will be:
* Examining the provided data
* Data preprocessing
* Calculations and adding results to the table
* Exploratory data analysis
* General conclusion

The project is made in **Jupyter Notebook**, Notebook server version: 6.1.4. **Python** 3.7.8.
The project uses the **Pandas**, **MatPlotLib** libraries and the **IPython** module.
