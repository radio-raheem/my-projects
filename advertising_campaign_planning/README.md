# Planning an advertising campaign for an online game store

Our customer is an online store that sells computer games all over the world. What games to sell? Which gaming platform is the most relevant right now? At the same time, we do not have our own data. No problem, let's take data from open sources.  
  

Our customer is an online store that sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow us to put our stake on potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.  
We have data up to 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and we are planning a campaign for 2017. We need to work out the principle of working with data. It doesn't matter whether we forecast sales for 2017 according to 2016 data or 2027 according to 2026 data.
The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "Adults Only 18+", "Everyone" or "Teen".
