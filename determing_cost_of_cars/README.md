# Determing the price of cars
  
A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers.
In it, you can quickly find out the market price of your car.
We have historical data: technical specifications, configurations and prices of cars. We need to build a model to determine the value.

Important for the customer:

- quality of prediction;
- prediction speed;
- training time.
 
 
The key steps of our project will be:

* Loading and preparing data
* Training different models. Hyperparameter adjustment
* Analysis of the speed of the models and their quality
  
The project is made in **Jupyter Notebook**, Notebook server version: 6.1.4. Version **Python** 3.7.8.
Libraries used in the project:
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **scikit-learn**
* **MatPlotLib**
* **Seaborne**
