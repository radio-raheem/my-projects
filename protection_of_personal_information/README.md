# Protection of personal data of clients 
  
We need to protect the data of the insurance company's customers. We will develop a data conversion method that makes it difficult to recover personal information from it.

You need to protect the data so that the quality of the machine learning models does not deteriorate during the transformation. There is no need to select the best model.
  
The key steps of our project will be:

* Loading and preparing data
* Matrix multiplication
* Suggestion of data transformation algorithm for solving the problem
* Algorithm programming by applying matrix operations
* Linear regression quality check. Studying the R2 score
  
The project is made in **Jupyter Notebook**, Notebook server version: 6.1.4. Version **Python** 3.7.8.
Libraries used in the project
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **scikit-learn**
* **IPython**
