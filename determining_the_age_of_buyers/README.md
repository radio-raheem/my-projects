# Determing the age of byers
  
A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos.
Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
* Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
* Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.
  
We need to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. We have at our disposal a set of photographs of people with age indications.
  
The key steps of our project will be:

* Exploratory analysis of a set of photographs
* Preparing data for training
* Training of neural networks. Determining the quality of a model
  
The project is made in **Jupyter Notebook**, Notebook server version: 6.1.4. Version **Python** 3.7.8.
Libraries used in the project:
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **MatPlotLib**
* **TensorFlow** (**Keras**)
* **IPython**
