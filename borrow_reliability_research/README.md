# Borrower reliability research
Many people take out loans. But how many of them return the money on time?  
Can we help the bank determine whether the borrower will repay the money on time, based on data such as the client's marital status and number of children? 

Let's do some research!

Input data from the customer - statistics on the solvency of customers. 
The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.

Let's describe the data.

children — number of children in the family
days_employed — total work expirience in days
dob_years — client's age in years
education — client's education level
education_id — educational level identifier
family_status — marital status
family_status_id — marital status identifier
gender — client gender
income_type — type of employment
debt — whether they were in debt to repay loans or not
total_income — monthly income
purpose — purpose of the loan



The main steps of our project will be:
* Opening a data file and examining general information
* Data preprocessing
* Calculations and adding the results necessary for analysis
* Data analysis
* Hypothesis testing
* Formulation of main conclusions

The project is made in **Jupyter Notebook**, **Python** 3.7.8.
The project uses the **Pandas** library, as well as the **IPython** module and **PyMyStem3** module.
