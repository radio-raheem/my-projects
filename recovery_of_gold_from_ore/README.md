# Recovery of gold from ore
  
Prototype a machine learning model for a company that develops industrial efficiency solutions.

The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. We have data with extraction and purification parameters.

The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

The key steps of our project will be:

* Loading and preparing data
* Verification of enrichment efficiency calculation
* Analysis of features not available in the test sample
* Data preprocessing
* Analysis of the concentrations of different metals at various stages of purification
* Comparison of the size distribution of raw material granules on the training and test samples
* Study of the total concentration of all substances at different stages
* Create a function to calculate the final sMAPE
* Training different models and assessing their quality by cross-validation. Choice of the best model.
